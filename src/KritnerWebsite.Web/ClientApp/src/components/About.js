            <h3>My Website</h3>

            <p>
                This is a personal website that I hope to use as a portfolio as well as continuing to learn new technologies and practices.
            </p>

            <h3>About me</h3>

            <p>
                I'm an application developer who got started building little web pages when I got my first computer around age 10 or so.
            My wife Kristen, our <del>soon to be born little baby</del> son Aaron, friends/family, learning/teaching, food, reading and movies/tv are the things that I care most about in life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Started out as a ColdFusion developer at Peregrin Services, and have expanded to mostly concentrate on full stack .net development.
            I have my SQL Server Development certification, and though I am "full stack" most of my experience is with server side c# and sql server.
            Any front end experience I have is mostly in web-forms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lately I've been trying to take PluralSight courses and play around with front-end frameworks like knockout and angular, as I feel like front end and javascript in general are weak areas of mine.
            This site is being built with the new .net core, and ideally I'll be able to do a few small applications built in a multitude of technologies to start to get a feel for the big world that is front-end development.
            </p>
